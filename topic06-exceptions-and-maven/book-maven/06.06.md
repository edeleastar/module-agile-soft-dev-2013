#Explore the local repo and use launch scripts

##Local Repository

Locate the local maven repository - it should be in your **home folder/.m2/repository**. It contains not just dependencies explicitly downloaded as part of the project you have just constructed, but also components downloaded by maven as part of the goals you have invoked. This may include components used by maven itself.

If you examine the repository, and recall the naming system we adopted for the Ascii Table component, then you can locate the generated jar file.


###Install Goal

We can install the component we just generated into the local maven repository.  To do this, navigate to the folder containing your pom.xml and type:

~~~
mvn install
~~~

In the output from the install command, you can see the directory structure associated with the install of your pacemaker jar file.

##Windows Launch Script

Executing the component from the command line requires a review of the locations of the generated jar file, and the associated libraries. The previous step will have centralized all of these into the maven 2 repository HOME/.m2/repository. The simplest mechanism for launching the application will be to compose a shell script.

The following Windows batch file contains the launch script to construct the classpath appropriately:

~~~
echo off

set M2_REPO=C:/Users/Siobhan/.m2/repository

set CLASSPATH=.;%CLASSPATH%;%M2_REPO%/pacemaker/pacemaker-console-maven/1.0/pacemaker-console-maven-1.0.jar;%M2_REPO%/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.10/xstream-1.4.10.jar;%M2_REPO%/com/google/guava/guava/23.0/guava.23.0.jar;%M2_REPO%/com/googlecode/clichemaven/cliche/110413/cliche-110413.jar;%M2_REPO%/java-ascii-table/java-ascii-table/1.0/java-ascii-table-1.0.jar;%M2_REPO%/joda-time/joda-time/1.0/joda-time-2.9.9.jar;

java controllers.Main
~~~

The first *set* command establishes the M2_REPO environment variable to abbreviate the location of the maven repository.  You will need to change this to reflect your directory structure.
The second *set* command establishes the CLASSPATH environment variable to include the pacemaker jar file, and also the required libraries (also located in the repository). 
The final entry is the launch command itself, which invokes the main method in the appropriate class.

The script is very sensitive to cases, semicolons and the presence of whitespace. Also, note carefully the structure of the M2_REPO folder path in particular.


##Unix Launch Script

On Unix/Linux/OS X, the script can be structured as follows...you will need to change it for your own directory strucutre, etc:

~~~
M2_REPO=/Users/edeleastar/.m2/repository

export CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%:\
${M2_REPO}/pacemaker/pacemaker-console-maven/1.0/pacemaker-console-maven-1.0.jar:\
${M2_REPO}/com/thoughtworks/xstream/xstream/1.4.10/xstream-1.4.10.jar:\
${M2_REPO}/com/google/guava/guava/23.0/guava.23.0.jar:\
${M2_REPO}/com/googlecode/clichemaven/cliche/110413/cliche-110413.jar:\
${M2_REPO}/java-ascii-table/java-ascii-table/1.0/java-ascii-table-1.0.jar:\
${M2_REPO}/joda-time/joda-time/1.0/joda-time-2.9.9.jar

java controllers.Main

##Launching the app from the command prompt

Based on your OS, run the desired script.  For example:

~~~
C:\Users\Siobhan\Desktop\agile workspace\pacemaker-console-maven>dir
 Volume in drive C is Windows
 Volume Serial Number is C6F4-3FE3

 Directory of C:\Users\Siobhan\Desktop\agile workspace\pacemaker-console-maven

See above...you should expect to be presented with the pacemaker console user interface.
