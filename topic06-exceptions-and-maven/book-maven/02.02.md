#5-minute Maven Guide

*In this step, you will work through the Maven example we covered in lectures.*

Navigate to this 5 minute guide:

- <http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html>

and, in your eclipse workspace directory, perform the steps involved in the **Creating a Project** section.

This will build a starter app called **my-app**.  Familiarise yourself with the struture of the generated folders and, in particular, the **pom.xml**.  Finish the tutorial by executing the generated Jar file.  "Hello World!" should be printed to the console.

For information on writing **pom.xml**, please visit:
