#Verify your Maven Installation

Visit the main Maven site:

- <http://maven.apache.org/>

and review some of the general introductions.

Then, enter the command **mvn -version** on your command shell.  You should see output similar to this:

~~~
C:\Users\Siobhan>mvn -version

Note the version of the JDK that Maven uses. There are significant differences between 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and the latest vesrsion 1.9.  In forthcoming labs, we will move to JDK9 (i.e. 1.9).  

If the above **mvn** command isn't recognised, revisit the steps below to install / fix your installation (maybe you installed it, but your path variables are not right).
