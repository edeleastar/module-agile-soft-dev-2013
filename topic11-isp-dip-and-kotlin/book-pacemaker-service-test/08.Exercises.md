## Exercise 1:

Test the deployed api. Currently, when the tests in pacemaker-skeleton-client launches, it is expecting the API on localhost:

~~~
  PacemakerAPI pacemaker = new PacemakerAPI("http://localhost:7000");
~~~ 

Change this to your deployed application url:

~~~
  PacemakerAPI pacemaker = new PacemakerAPI("https://fierce-brook-34.herokuapp.com/");
~~~

(Use your own url here)

And run all tests. They should pass. Keep an eye on the logs as the test run.

## Exercise 2

Try the same experiment with the pacemaker CLI. I.e. change PacemakerConsoleService

~~~
public class PacemakerConsoleService {

  private PacemakerAPI paceApi = new PacemakerAPI("http://localhost:7000");
~~~

to use the deployed application:

~~~
public class PacemakerConsoleService {

  PacemakerAPI pacemaker = new PacemakerAPI("https://fierce-brook-34.herokuapp.com/");
~~~

## Exercise 3:

Explore the deployed service using the Restlet Chrome plugin

## Exercise 4:

Evolve a set of tests to verify that locations can be added to activities.
