These are the commands for Assignment 2 - and are implemented as stubbs in PacemakerConsoleService class.

A scaled down implementation of the API is implemented in PacemakerAPI. It includes the primary features of the sample solution, simplified to exclude serialization.

The models are similar - but starttime and duration have been removed from the Activity class.
