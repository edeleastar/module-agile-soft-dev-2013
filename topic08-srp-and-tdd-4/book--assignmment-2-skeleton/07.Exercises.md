# Exercises

Archive of the lab so far:

- <https://github.com/wit-computing-msc-2017/pacemaker-skeleton/releases/tag/lab08.end>

# Exercise 1:

implement the Add Location Command

# Exercise 2:

implement the List Location Command

# Exercise 3:

Implement the Activity Report Command. There are two of these commands:

- (a) taking no parameters - which sorts the activities by type

- (b) talking a single parameter - the activity type. This command only lists activities of the specified type. However, they are to be sorted by distance, longest to shortest.

## Note:

These exercises are solved in the next lab. Exercise 1 & 2 are relatively straightforward, and can be solved by looking at the sample solution to the assignment.

Exercise 3 (a) is also fairly straightforward, but exercise (b) might take a little more consideration.
