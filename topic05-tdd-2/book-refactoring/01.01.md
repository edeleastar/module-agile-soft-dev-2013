# ID Management

Currently we are using Long id for our users and activitiy objects:

~~~
public class Activity implements Serializable
{ 
  static Long   counter = 0l;  
  public Long   id;
~~~

~~~
public class User implements Serializable
{ 
  static Long   counter = 0l;
  public Long   id;
~~~

This defines the structure of the various collections we are using:

~~~
public class PacemakerAPI
{
  private Map<String, User>   emailIndex = new HashMap<>();
  private Map<Long, User>     userIndex  = new HashMap<>();
  private Map<Long, Activity> activitiesIndex = new HashMap<>();
~~~

While this works (more or less), you may have noticed some flaws. These center around the `counter`s, stored as static members of the Activity and User classes respectively.

The role of these counters is to facilitate generation of id's when we create new objects. For example:

~~~
  public User(String firstName, String lastName, String email, String password)
  {
    this.id        = counter++;
    ...
  }
~~~

We are simply increasing the counter by one every time a new user is created.

Can you see any flaw in this approach?

Specifically, if you restart the app, and load a previously saved model - what will be the value of these counters? What happens when you insert a new User for instance?

See if you can perform an experiment to exercise the above scenario.
