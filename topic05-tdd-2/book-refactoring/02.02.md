# Refactor User ID

You may have seen that the problem with the last step was the ids were reset to 0 when the app was launched. Thus, any new users or activities would overwrite already created users/activities - corrupting the data structure.

This is clearly a serious bug - one not picked up by our unit tests. In fact it is a difficult bug to pick up in the test infrastructure and you may only be able to reproduce using the command line.

Out solution will be to abandon this approach completely - and adopt a different strategy for managing ids. We can switch to using Immutable Universally unique Identifiers

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>

A generate for these ids is available in the JDK:

- <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html>

This seems like a significant change - effecting many aspects of the application. However, because we have a suite of unit tests in place, we can evolve the application in an orderly manner. 

First, change the User class:

~~~
...
import java.util.UUID;
...

public class User implements Serializable
{
  //static Long   counter = 0l;
  
  public String   id;
  ...

 public User(String firstName, String lastName, String email, String password)
  {
    //this.id        = counter++;
    this.id = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    ..
  }
...
~~~

In the above we have commented out the counter - each new object receive a new unique id.

There will be errors throughout the application. We can start with the User Test class:

~~~
...
  @Test
  public void testIds()
  {
    Set<String> ids = new HashSet<>();
    for (User user : users)
    {
      ids.add(user.id);
    }
    assertEquals (users.length, ids.size());
  }
...  
~~~

The above version should now compile successfully. We should also be able to run just this test (even though there are errors elsewhere). It should pass.
