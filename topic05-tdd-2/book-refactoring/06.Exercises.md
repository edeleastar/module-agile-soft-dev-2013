## Exercise 1: UUID Ids for Activity & Location

Consider refactoring Activity and Location classes to use an ID based on UUID as we have implemented for the User class. Make sure you also rework the tests and get used to relying on the these tests to ensure the project is evolving in an orderly manner.

## Exercise 2: ASCII Table

Introduce ASCII table into all commands, following the example of step 05

## Exercise 3: Joda Time

Last week we referred you to this library:

- <http://www.joda.org/joda-time/>

This library arose as a result of inadequacies in date/time handing in the JDK. These have been largely resolved in Java 8, however there are some advantages to using Joda time:

- It support for Duration is simpler and more usable that Java 8
- Earlier JDK & Android support. The Joda Time library is available for a wider range of JDK versions.

There are, however, counter arguments. A useful discussion here:

Feel free to use either in your assignment.
