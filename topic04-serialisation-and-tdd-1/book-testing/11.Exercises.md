##Remaining Commands

From last weeks lab, we still have these commands outstanding - sorted based on estimated potential complexity of the implementation:

~~~
abbrev  name               params
---------------------------------------------------
du      delete-user        (user id)
lius    list-user          (user id)
la      list-activities    (user id)
l       load               ()
s       store              ()
la      list-activities    (userid, sortBy: type, location, distance, date, duration)
cff     change-file-format (file format: xml, json)
~~~

- The first three commands are relatively straightforward. We already have tests that exercise the features these commands rely on, to we can proceed to implement these commands in main.

- Load and store are also tested reasonably comprehensively via the PacemakerAPITest series, so implementing these commands should be doable with some confidence.

- The last two commands are more challenging, and ideally should be tackled from a test first perspective. This means formulating a test case that will exercise the feature, writing the test and then implementing, or partially implementing, the feature such that the test passes.


##Time Date Support

Still outstanding inn the pacemaker is the support of start date and time. You may choose to postpone this until some of the above commands are tackled, or take it on in advance. Date time handling in Java has had some well recognised challenges:

The joda time library was used to overcome some of the well documented issues with date and time:

Java 8 sees a new date and time library:

- <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-date-time-2125367.html> 

This can be seen as a replacement for joda time if Java 8 is available. This is the package summary documentation:

- <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html>

##Formatting

The ideal format, as specified in the specification, pretty prints the output like this:

~~~

+----+-----------+----------+-------------------+----------+
| ID | FIRSTNAME | LASTNAME |       EMAIL       | PASSWORD |
+----+-----------+----------+-------------------+----------+
|  1 |     homer |  simpsom | homer@simpson.com |   secret |
|  2 |     marge |  simpson | marge@simpson.com |   secret |
+----+-----------+----------+-------------------+----------+

+----+------+----------+----------+-------------------------------+----------+-----------------------------------+
| ID | TYPE | LOCATION | DISTANCE |           STARTTIME           | DURATION |               ROUTE               |
+----+------+----------+----------+-------------------------------+----------+-----------------------------------+
|  1 | walk |   fridge |    0.001 | 2013-10-12T09:00:00.000+01:00 |  PT3600S | [23.3,32.3, 23.3,32.5, 23.3,32.6] |
|  2 | walk |      bar |        1 | 2013-10-13T09:00:00.000+01:00 |  PT4200S |                                [] |
|  3 |  run |     work |      2.2 | 2013-10-14T09:00:00.000+01:00 |   PT600S |                                [] |
+----+------+----------+----------+-------------------------------+----------+-----------------------------------+

Writing code to do this could be very tedious. These components here implement convenient solutions to this problem:

### Ascii Table

- <https://github.com/robinhowlett/java-ascii-table>

### Wagu

- <https://github.com/thedathoudarya/WAGU-data-in-table-view>

... and there are others.

If you are relatively new to Java, incorporating these libraries may be challenging. In next weeks lab we will explore how to introduce one of these libraries into the project.
