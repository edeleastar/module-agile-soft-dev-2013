#Objectives

Equip Pacemaker with JUnit libraries and then introduce a range of tests to verify essential features. Correct issues that arise as a result of the tests, becoming familiar with the fail/pass/refactor/pass cycle. Review the outstanding command set of the application.  We will use JUnit 4 in this lab.
