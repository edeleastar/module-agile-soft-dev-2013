##Serialization

We would like our system to remember our user and activity data between sessions. In lab 1 we explored the xstream component briefly. We will reuse it here to save the entire model on exit from the application, and reload on startup.

Here is a refactoring of the main method to bring in load/store to the application life cycle:

~~~java
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
  {
    Main main = new Main();
    
    File  datastore = new File("datastore.xml");
    if (datastore.isFile())
    {
      main.paceApi.load(datastore);
    }

    Shell shell = ShellFactory.createConsoleShell("pm", "Welcome to pacemaker-console - ?help for instructions", main);
    shell.commandLoop();
    
    main.paceApi.store(datastore);
  }
~~~

In the above main method, we check to see if the file 'datastore.xml' exists. If so, we attempt to load a model from it. If not, we proceed with a blank model.

On exit (i.e. when 'exit' is typed from the console) we ask the model to store itself. 

Thus we need two new methods in PacemakerApi:

- load
- store

Here they are:

~~~java
  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
  public void load(File file) throws Exception
  {
    ObjectInputStream is = null;
    try
    {
      XStream xstream = new XStream(new DomDriver());
      is = xstream.createObjectInputStream(new FileReader(file));
      userIndex       = (Map<Long, User>)     is.readObject();
      emailIndex      = (Map<String, User>)   is.readObject();
      activitiesIndex = (Map<Long, Activity>) is.readObject();
    }
    catch(EOFException e) 
    {
    }
    finally
    {
      if (is != null)
      {
        is.close();
      }
    }
  }
  
  public void store(File file) throws Exception
  {
    XStream xstream = new XStream(new DomDriver());
    ObjectOutputStream out = xstream.createObjectOutputStream(new FileWriter(file));
    out.writeObject(userIndex);
    out.writeObject(emailIndex);
    out.writeObject(activitiesIndex);
    out.close(); 
  }
~~~

Take some time to read these now - and try them out.

In particular, see if you can locate the 'datastore.xml' file after the app has exited. You will need to 'refresh' your workspace for it to appear in eclipse project explorer.

If all goes to plan, and say you run the script we explored earlier, then in eclipse you should be able to examine the datastore file in an xml editor. It could look like this:
