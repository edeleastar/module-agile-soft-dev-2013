#Objectives

Extend the pacemaker application to include Activity and Location classes + associated commands. Once these are in place, incorporate a serialization mechanism to enable users & activities to be persisted to a file. We will then try to generalize this mechanism, which will enable us to experiment with alternative serialization formats.
