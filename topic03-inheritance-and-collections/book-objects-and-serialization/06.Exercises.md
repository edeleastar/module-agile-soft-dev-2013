##Alternative Serializers

We have taken some time to abstract the serialization mechanism. This should enable us to introduce new serializers to adhere to alternative formats. Write two new serializers which support the following formats:

- Json
- Binary

Json is supported via xstream and the jettison library.  A tutorial is available on the xstream site:

- <http://x-stream.github.io/json-tutorial.html>

A Binary serializer can be written just using the native streams in the JDK. 

##Features

Run your app, or the solution made available above and list all commands:

~~~
!la
~~~

This will list a range of 'built-in' commands + the commands we have implemented so far:

~~~
abbrev  name              params
---------------------------------------------------
cu      create-user      (first name, last name, email, password)
gu      get-user         (email)
gu      get-users        ()
du      delete-user      (email)
aa      add-activity     (user-id, type, location, distance)
al      add-location     (activity-id, latitude, longitude) 
~~~

Review the command set as specified in the assignment:

~~~
abbrev	name			        params
---------------------------------------------------
lu    list-users          ()
cu    create-user         (first name, last name, email, password)
lu    list-user           (email)
lius  list-user           (id)
la    list-activities     (userid, sortBy: type, location, distance, date, duration)
la    list-activities     (user id)
du    delete-user         (id)
aa    add-activity        (user-id, type, location, distance, datetime, duration)
al    add-location        (activity-id, latitude, longitude)
cff   change-file-format  (file format: xml, json)
l     load                ()
s     store               ()
~~~

Some commands are more or less complete:

~~~
abbrev  name              params
---------------------------------------------------
cu      reate-user       (first name, last name, email, password)
gu      get-user         (email)
gu      get-users        ()
du      delete-user      (email)
~~~

Some are partially complete - the activities are in place, but do not include start time or duration:

~~~
abbrev  name              params
---------------------------------------------------
aa      add-activity      (user-id, type, location, distance)
al      add-location      (activity-id, latitude, longitude)
~~~

and these commands are yet to be tackled:

~~~
abbrev  name               params
---------------------------------------------------
lius    list-user          (id)
la      list-activities    (userid, sortBy: type, location, distance, date, duration)
la      list-activities    (user id)
du      delete-user        (id)
cff     change-file-format (file format: xml, json)
l       load               ()
s       store              ()
~~~

Prioritize these commands from simplest to most complex, and consider tackling the simpler commands first.
