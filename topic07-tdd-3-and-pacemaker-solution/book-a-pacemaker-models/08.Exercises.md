## Exercise 1: Maven test

Run the tests using the `mvn test` command. Verify that all tests pass, as is shown in the following output:

## Exercise 2: Maven Coverage Reports

In Eclipse, select **Run**, followed by **Coverage...**.

When the Coverage Configurations window appears, click on the **Coverage** tab and confine the analysis to the **src/main/java** folder, as is shown below:

When you click the **Coverage** button, the JUnit tests should run and a coverage analysis presented to you:

This report clearly shows that our models need to have more JUnit tests written to bring up the percentage from the low 30's to a recommended coverage of 80%. 

Try adding in more tests and watch the % rise.

Note that running analysis on the coverage % does not generate any coverage reports to the *target* directory:

You can export the coverage analyis:

- manually: **File**, **Export...**, **Run/Debug**, **Coverage Session**.
- via maven to the target directory: using the plugin below and running the **mvn jacoco:report** command.

## The next lab...

With a set of models + unit tests + initial fixtures in place, we have a solid foundation for proceeding to implement the core API + console user interface (next lab).
