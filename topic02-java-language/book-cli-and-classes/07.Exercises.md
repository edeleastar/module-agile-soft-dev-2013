##1: New Commands

Expand the Main class to include two new commands

- add-activity: this will add an activity to a specific user.
- add-location: this will add a location (latitude,longitude) to a specific activity.

If the user enters ?listall in the command prompt, then the should see this:

~~~
cu	create-user	(first name, last name, email, password)
gu	get-user	(email)
gu	get-users	()
du	delete-user	(email)
aa	add-activity	(user-id, type, location, distance)
al	add-location	(activity-id, latitude, longitude)
~~~

##2: New Classes

Implementing this will require two new classes:

Activity consisting of:

 - id
 - type (string)
 - location (string)
 - distance (double)

Location:

 - id
 - latitude (double)
 - longitude (double)

Model these classes on the structure of the User class - including toString and hash functions.

##3: Relationships

The User class is to have a map of Activities something like this:

~~~java
  public Map<Long, Activity> activities = new HashMap<>();
~~~

... and the Activiy class is to have a list of Locations:

~~~java
  public List<Location> route = new ArrayList<>();
~~~

If all goes to plan, a transcript of a session at the command line might look like this:

~~~
Welcome to pcemaker-console - ?help for instructions
pc> cu homer simpsom homer@simpson.com secret
pc> gu
[User{0, homer, simpsom, secret, homer@simpson.com, {}}]
pc> cu marge simpson marge@simpson.com secret
pc> gu
[User{0, homer, simpsom, secret, homer@simpson.com, {}}, User{1, marge, simpson, secret, marge@simpson.com, {}}]
pc> aa 0 walk fridge .001
pc> aa 0 walk bar 1.0
pc> aa 0 run work 2.2
pc> gu
[User{0, homer, simpsom, secret, homer@simpson.com, {0=Activity{0, walk, fridge, 0.001, []}, 1=Activity{1, walk, bar, 1.0, []}, 2=Activity{2, run, work, 2.2, []}}}, User{1, marge, simpson, secret, marge@simpson.com, {}}]
pc> aa 1 walk shop 2.5
pc> aa 1 cycle shop 4.5
pc> al 3 23.3 32.3
pc> al 3 23.3 32.5
pc> al 3 23.3 32.6
pc> gu
[User{0, homer, simpsom, secret, homer@simpson.com, {0=Activity{0, walk, fridge, 0.001, []}, 1=Activity{1, walk, bar, 1.0, []}, 2=Activity{2, run, work, 2.2, []}}}, User{1, marge, simpson, secret, marge@simpson.com, {3=Activity{3, walk, shop, 2.5, [Location{0, 23.3, 32.3}, Location{1, 23.3, 32.5}, Location{2, 23.3, 32.6}]}, 4=Activity{4, cycle, shop, 4.5, []}}}]
pc> 
~~~

just to make it clear, this is a pretty printed version of the final command (you don't need to progam this):

~~~
pc> gu
[
  User{0, homer, simpsom, secret, homer@simpson.com, 
       { 0=Activity {0, walk, fridge, 0.001, []}, 
         1=Activity {1, walk, bar, 1.0, []}, 
         2=Activity {2, run, work, 2.2, []} } }, 
  User{1, marge, simpson, secret, marge@simpson.com, 
       { 3=Activity{3, walk, shop, 2.5, 
               [ Location{0, 23.3, 32.3}, 
                 Location{1, 23.3, 32.5}, 
                 Location{2, 23.3, 32.6}]}, 
         4=Activity{4, cycle, shop, 4.5, []} } } 
]
