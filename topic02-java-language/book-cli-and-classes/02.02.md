#Command Line Skeleton

We would like to create a small application to experiment with our User class.

Firsy, we need two components/libraries which will expidite some of the more mundane tasks. These are:

- <https://code.google.com/p/cliche/>
- <https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/>

Locate the jar file from each of these projects, download and incorporate into your eclipse project. The jars can be located here:

- <https://code.google.com/archive/p/cliche/downloads>
- <https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/Release23>

Use the guide on importing the xstream component in last week to help in the steps needed in Eclipse.

Your project should look something like this if the import has gone successfully.

![](./img/01.png)

Open Main.java, and replace its contents with the following:

~~~java
package controllers;

import java.io.IOException;
import asg.cliche.Command;
import asg.cliche.Shell;
import asg.cliche.ShellFactory;

public class Main
{
  @Command
  public void createUser (String firstName,  String lastName, 
                          String email,      String password)
  {
  }
  
  @Command
  public void getUser (String email)
  {

  }
  
  @Command
  public void getUsers ()
  {

  }
  
  @Command
  public void deleteUser (String email)
  {
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
  {
    Shell shell = ShellFactory.createConsoleShell("pc", "Welcome to pacemaker-console - ?help for instructions", new Main());
    shell.commandLoop(); 
  }
}
~~~

Run this application now, and explore the various commands (start with ?help).

We can annotate our commands with some help information which will turn up when you list the commands.

~~~java
  @Command(description="Create a new User")
  public void createUser (String firstName,  String lastName, 
                          String email,      String password)
  {
  }
  
  @Command(description="Get a Users details")
  public void getUser (String email)
  {

  }
  
  @Command(description="Get all users details")
  public void getUsers ()
  {

  }
  
  @Command(description="Delete a User")
  public void deleteUser (String email)
  {
  }
~~~

Try this now and verify that the help text appears as expected.

We can also annotate the parameters:

~~~java
  @Command(description="Create a new User")
  public void createUser (@Param(name="first name") String firstName, @Param(name="last name") String lastName, 
                          @Param(name="email")      String email,     @Param(name="password")  String password)
  {
  }
  
  @Command(description="Get a Users details")
  public void getUser (@Param(name="email") String email)
  {

  }
  
  @Command(description="Get all users details")
  public void getUsers ()
  {

  }
  
  @Command(description="Delete a User")
  public void deleteUser (@Param(name="email") String email)
  {
  }
~~~

The following import will need to me included:

~~~java
import asg.cliche.Param;
~~~

for this to compile. See if you can generate the import using the auto-correct feature of eclipse.

Make sure now when you run the app that the correct help information appears for each command.
