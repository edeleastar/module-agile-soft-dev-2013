#IDs

We might wish to use IDs in addition to emails when referencing out users. The User class can be extended to include these attributes:

~~~java
public class User 
{
  static Long   counter = 0l;
  
  public Long   id;
  //...  
  
  public User(String firstName, String lastName, String email, String password)
  {
    this.id        = counter++;
    //...
  }
~~~

We can think think of the principal users collection as the userIndex, and introduce a separate collection call emailIndex - which stores the same object against a different key for rapid access:

~~~java
public class PacemakerAPI
{
  private Map<Long, User>     userIndex       = new HashMap<>();
  private Map<String, User>   emailIndex      = new HashMap<>();
      
  public Collection<User> getUsers ()
  {
    return userIndex.values();
  }
  
  public  void deleteUsers() 
  {
    userIndex.clear();
    emailIndex.clear();
  }
  
  public User createUser(String firstName, String lastName, String email, String password) 
  {
    User user = new User (firstName, lastName, email, password);
    userIndex.put(user.id, user);
    emailIndex.put(email, user);
    return user;
  }
  
  public User getUserByEmail(String email) 
  {
    return emailIndex.get(email);
  }

  public User getUser(Long id) 
  {
    return userIndex.get(id);
  }

  public void deleteUser(Long id) 
  {
    User user = userIndex.remove(id);
    emailIndex.remove(user.email);
  }
}
~~~

Review the above code - note getUser and deleteUser have been adjusted to use IDs.

The delete user command will need to be changed to use IDs instead:

~~~java
public class Main
{
  PacemakerAPI paceApi = new PacemakerAPI();

  @Command(description="Delete a User")
  public void deleteUser (@Param(name="email") String email)
  {
    User user = paceApi.getUserByEmail(email);
    paceApi.deleteUser(user.id);
  }
...
~~~

Test this now - and verify that you can create and delete a user. Try to delete a user that does not exist - what happens? This is a classic null pointer exception .. occurring in the delete method above. A well known problem, discussed here:

- [Billion Dollar Mistake](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3186)

We could, of course, just checked for it:

~~~java
    User user = paceApi.getUserByEmail(email);
    if (null != user)
      paceApi.deleteUser(user.id);
~~~

Try this now and verify the absence of the exception.

The guava library has an interesting take on how to avoid the error:

- [Guava Options](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/UsingAndAvoidingNullExplained#Optional)

.. and specifically recommends against the above style. They would propose the following version:

~~~java
  @Command(description="Delete a User")
  public void deleteUser (@Param(name="email") String email)
  {
    Optional<User> user = Optional.fromNullable(paceApi.getUserByEmail(email));
    if (user.isPresent())
    {
      paceApi.deleteUser(user.get().id);
    }
  }
~~~

Commit these changes with a suitable message.
