We are going to bootstrap a simple REST service from our existing API, and implement a number of initial endpoints.

## Dependencies

These are the initial dependencies to enable out skeleton app to support an rest service:

~~~
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.javalin</groupId>
      <artifactId>javalin</artifactId>
      <version>0.5.1</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
      <version>1.7.21</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
      <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
      <version>2.9.1</version>
    </dependency>
~~~

Place these in your POM alongside the other dependencies. You may need to run the following command in a shell inside your project:

~~~
mvn package
~~~

This will download the dependencies to your local maven repo. If you refresh eclipse, you should see a range of new dependencies:

Although we only included 3 entries - note that a range of upstream modules were also incorporated into our build path.
