#Install JDK

The first step is to locate the Java Software Development Kit in this Oracle web site:

-  <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>

On this page, download the latest JDK and save to your local disk.  The various SDKs are usually downloaded from here:

- <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>

Make sure to select the correct one for your system.

Once it is downloaded, locate the file on your hard disk (it may be on your desktop) and run it.

During the installation process it will install two subsystems

- JRE
- JDK

Keep an eye on where these are installed, as both are important.
